# Contract vs Runtime Implementation Report

Autogenerated diagnostic: compares ARCHITECTURE_AUTOGEN–documented engines/systems/contracts to actual code and runtime wiring. Status reflects execution truth only.

---

| System / Engine | Documented in Architecture | Exists in Code | Wired Into Runtime | Status |
|-----------------|---------------------------|----------------|--------------------|--------|
| Layout Compatibility Engine | YES | YES | YES | ✅ Active |
| Layout Resolution (resolveLayout, getDefaultSectionLayoutId) | YES | YES | YES | ✅ Active |
| Layout Decision Engine | YES | NO | NO | ❌ Missing |
| User Preference Adaptation | YES | NO | NO | ❌ Missing |
| Suggestion Injection Point | YES | NO | NO | ❌ Missing |
| Contextual Layout Logic | YES | NO | NO | ❌ Missing |
| Trait Registry System | YES | NO | NO | ❌ Missing |
| State and Override Orchestration | YES | YES | YES | ✅ Active |
| Logic ↔ Layout Contract | YES | N/A (interface only) | No Logic engines in layout path | ⚠️ Partial |
| Behavior Event Wiring / State Intent | YES | YES | YES | ✅ Active |
| Organ Expansion Contract | YES | YES | YES | ✅ Active |
| Skin Application Contract | YES | YES | YES | ✅ Active |
| Runtime Pipeline Contract | YES | YES | YES | ✅ Active |
| Explainability / Trace | YES | NO | NO | ❌ Missing |
| Engine Registry (getPresentation, applyEngine) | Referenced in flows | YES | Only when flow/TSX engine-viewer loads | ⚠️ Partial |
| Data Flow Contract | YES | YES | YES | ✅ Active |
| State Shape Contract | YES | YES | YES | ✅ Active |
| RUNTIME_FALLBACKS (generated) | YES | YES | YES | ✅ Active |
| Screen JSON Schema | YES | YES | Referenced by runtime shape | ✅ Active |
| Registry Map (type → component) | YES | YES | YES | ✅ Active |
| Blueprint / Runtime Interface | YES | YES | Design-time; not in render path | ⚠️ Partial |
| State Influence Rules | YES | N/A (contract only) | Logic not wired | ⚠️ Partial |

**Status meanings:**
- **✅ Active** — Documented, exists in code, and participates in runtime execution.
- **⚠️ Partial** — Referenced but not fully wired (e.g. only on alternate paths, or interface-only).
- **❌ Orphaned** — Exists in code but never used in the traced runtime path.
- **❌ Missing** — Documented but no implementation found.

## Summary

- **Total Documented Systems:** 22
- **Active:** 12
- **Orphaned:** 0
