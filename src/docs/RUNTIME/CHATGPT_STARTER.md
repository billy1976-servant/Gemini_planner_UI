# CHATGPT_STERTER

**Purpose:** Startup context for a new ChatGPT session.

## Read this first

This project uses **code-derived architecture contracts**. Architecture is not invented in documentation; it is extracted from the codebase and written into specific doc folders. Any advice you give must align with those extracted contracts.

---

## Authoritative sources

Before giving architecture, layout, behavior, or state advice:

1. **Read** the contents of:
  - `src/docs/ARCHITECTURE_AUTOGEN`
  - `src/docs/SYSTEM_MAP_AUTOGEN`
2. Treat every document in those folders as the current system definition: runtime pipeline, layout resolution, behavior/state wiring, registry map, data flow, and any generated schemas or contracts.

---

## Rules for the AI

- **Do not invent architecture.** If something is not in the contracts or the code, say so; do not assume or fabricate.
- **Do not rely on memory.** Re-read the relevant contract or SYSTEM_MAP_AUTOGEN / ARCHITECTURE_AUTOGEN files when answering; do not depend on prior conversation or training data for this project’s structure.
- **Align all reasoning with extracted contracts.** When suggesting changes, new features, or fixes, cite the contract or doc that supports or constrains your answer. If a contract is missing or unclear, state that and suggest a clarification or update only after the user confirms.

## How to use this in a new session

1. Paste or reference this file (CHATGPT_STERTER.md) at the start of the session.
2. Tell the AI: “Before answering, read src/docs/ARCHITECTURE_AUTOGEN and src/docs/SYSTEM_MAP_AUTOGEN.”
3. Ask your question; the AI must base its answer on those docs and the code, not on assumptions.
