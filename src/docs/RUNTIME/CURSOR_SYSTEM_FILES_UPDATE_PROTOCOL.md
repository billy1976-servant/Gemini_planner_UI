# ***SYSTEM_FILES_UPDATE_PROTOCOL***

***Purpose: Fast architecture drift detection and contract sync (diff-first, not full regeneration).***

## ***When to Run***

- ***After major refactors, new subsystems, or layout/behavior/state changes***
- ***When autogenerated docs feel out of date or unclear***
- ***Before large planning or execution work***

---

## ***Steps (execute in order)***

### ***1. Scan the repository source code (lightweight structural pass)***

- ***Scan all source under src/ (and any other folders that contain runtime/engine code)***
- ***Include: engine, layout, state, organs, compounds, UI, registries, loaders, and entry points***
- ***Build a structural mental model only (do NOT write files yet)***

***Focus on identifying changes to:***

- ***Entry points***
- ***Runtime pipeline stages***
- ***Layout resolution flow***
- ***Behavior → state wiring***
- ***Registry definitions***
- ***Data flow into renderer***

---

### ***2. Re-derive current contracts in memory only***

***Reconstruct the current architecture from code:***

- ***Runtime pipeline: Request → resolution → render path → fallbacks***
- ***Layout resolution order and compatibility filtering***
- ***Behavior/state wiring (who reads/writes what)***
- ***Registry map (types → components → files)***
- ***Data flow (screen/JSON/content → renderer)***

***⚠️ Do NOT regenerate any docs yet.***

---

### ***3. Compare against existing autogenerated docs (diff-first)***

***Read all files in:***

- ***src/docs/ARCHITECTURE_AUTOGEN/***
- ***src/docs/SYSTEM_MAP_AUTOGEN/***

***For each doc:***

- ***Compare its described contracts to the current code-derived picture***
- ***Identify only meaningful architectural differences***

***Do not rewrite unchanged sections.***

---

### ***4. Produce a DIFF REPORT (no regeneration)***

***Create one report listing:***

### ***🔴 Outdated docs***

***Docs that no longer match runtime behavior***  
 ***→ Include 1–3 bullet points describing the mismatch***

### ***🟡 Missing docs***

***Architectural contracts found in code that have no doc***

### ***🟢 New contracts discovered***

***New patterns or systems not yet reflected in autogen docs***

---

### ***5. Propose updates (do not apply)***

***For each affected doc:***

- ***Provide only the changed sections***
- ***Label clearly:***  
 ***“Proposed update for: [filename.md](http://filename.md)”***

***⚠️ Do NOT regenerate entire files***  
 ***⚠️ Do NOT overwrite anything***

---

### ***6. User confirmation required***

***After presenting the DIFF REPORT:***

- ***Wait for user approval before modifying any files***
- ***Apply only approved updates***
- ***Leave all other files untouched***

## ***Output***

- ***One DIFF REPORT (outdated / missing / new contracts)***
- ***Proposed updates for only the affected autogenerated docs***
- ***No file changes until user confirms***
