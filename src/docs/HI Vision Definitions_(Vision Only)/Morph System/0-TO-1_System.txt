(Exhaustive explanation of theme scaling, UI scaling, and how atoms map to 0→1)
# HI OS — The 0→1 Universal Parameter System


The 0→1 engine is the root of UI consistency.


Every display property is defined between 0.0 (minimum state) and 1.0 (maximum state).
This includes:
- typography scale
- spacing scale
- roundness
- density
- shadow depth
- surface elevation
- opacity
- animation intensity
- contrast
- motion softness
- color logic
- cultural UI modes
- child modes (Kids, Simple, Developer, Minimalist)


Example:
font-size = interpolate(0→1, min=12px, mid=16px, max=22px)


Everything in the UI becomes predictable:
0.0 = smallest, simplest, flattest  
0.5 = standard Google/Material size  
0.8 = Apple-like high-clarity, softer/rounder  
1.0 = Kids mode (big, chunky, playful)


Atoms accept 0→1 directly.  
Molecules aggregate multiple 0→1 values.  
Compounds map UI state onto 0→1 for rendering.


This file defines how scaling works system-wide.
