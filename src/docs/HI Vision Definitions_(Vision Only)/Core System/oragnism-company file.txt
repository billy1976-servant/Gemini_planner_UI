ORGANISM / APP (QuickBooks: “The Company File”)
What the ORGANISM is
The Organism (or “App”) is the full HI-CURV experience the user sees:
 all organs + screens + navigation + behaviors + content + data engine working together.
In practice, it is:
one main screen JSON (or a small set of them)
a set of organs wired into slots
the Brain / data engine feeding those organs with the right slice of the user’s life.
How screens work
A screen is not where the logic lives; it’s just a layout + wiring description:
“Put navbar organ here”
“Put Kanban organ here”
“Put Calendar organ here”
A different view (List, Calendar, Kanban) is just a different combination of organs, fed by the same underlying data.
Why this matters
You are not building separate, isolated apps.
 You are building one organism whose organs share the same bloodstream (tasks, projects, relationships, schedule, media, etc.).
This is what makes “switch from calendar to Kanban to journal on the same content” possible:
 the organism is one system; views are just different projections.
