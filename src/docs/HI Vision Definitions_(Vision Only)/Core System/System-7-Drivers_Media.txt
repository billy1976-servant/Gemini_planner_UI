# SYSTEM-7 DRIVERS — HI MEDIA MODEL (EXHAUSTIVE DEFINITION)


## 0. PURPOSE OF SYSTEM-7


System-7 is the “driver layer” of the HI OS.


It defines **seven universal channels** that describe *everything* the OS cares about for a human using tools:


1. MEDIA         — what was captured or loaded (HI Media)
2. CONTENT       — what it means (ideas, topics, relationships)
3. ENVIRONMENT   — where/when/how it was experienced
4. TIMELINE      — how it unfolds over time
5. IDENTITY      — who is involved (roles, profiles, preferences)
6. PARAMETERS    — knobs, limits, constraints, budgets
7. STYLE         — how it looks/feels/reads


**Key idea:** instead of treating these as separate APIs, System-7 says:
> “Every meaningful action in HI OS is a combination of these 7 channels.”


So any screen, sequence, or tool can ask:
- *“What MEDIA is present?”*
- *“What CONTENT does it carry?”*
- *“What ENVIRONMENT is it in?”*
- *“Where on the TIMELINE are we?”*
- *“Whose IDENTITY is this?”*
- *“What PARAMETERS matter?”*
- *“What STYLE and mood are active?”*


This is the backbone for:
- consistent analysis  
- consistent export  
- consistent “morphing” between apps (journal → planner → editor, etc.)

## 1. HI MEDIA (SYSTEM-7 CHANNEL #1)


HI MEDIA is **not** “just video” or “just an image.”


It is a **single, unified capture** that can contain:


- video frames
- still images / keyframes
- audio (voice, ambient sound, music)
- spatial / LiDAR depth data
- positional / motion data (camera path, device motion)
- environment metadata (light levels, color temperature, etc.)
- on-screen overlays (teleprompter text, UI, highlights)
- interaction traces (where the user tapped, dragged, scrubbed)
- measurement anchors (points, lines, planes for distance/area/volume)
- annotations (notes, labels, tags, entities)


All of that is treated as **ONE HI media object** (an HI container), NOT a pile of separate APIs.


### 1.1. NO EXTERNAL API DEPENDENCY (CONCEPT)


In HI MEDIA, the *capture* itself already includes:


- audio
- video
- depth
- spatial context
- interaction
- annotations


So **tools read from one rich source**, rather than:


- calling a video API, then
- calling an audio API, then
- calling a separate LiDAR API, then
- calling a computer vision API, etc.


**Conceptual rule:**
> “HI MEDIA is the richest available snapshot of what really happened in that moment, captured once and reused everywhere.”


### 1.2. EXPORT TO “DUMBER” FORMATS


From any HI media object, the system can export:


- MP4 / WebM       → video only
- MP3 / WAV        → audio only
- JPG / PNG        → single frame or keyframes
- PDF              → snapshots with annotations and captions
- JSON             → metadata / measurements / analysis
- image sequence   → for editing pipelines


Exports are **one-directional simplifications**:


- HI MEDIA → MP4 (loss of depth, spatial, annotations, etc.)
- HI MEDIA → JPG (one frame, no audio, no depth, etc.)


The HI container remains the “truth”; the exports are just views.


**Why this is critical:**


- Tools can stay **future-proof**: when new export types appear (e.g. holographic format), the HI container doesn’t change — only the exporter does.
- Users keep **maximal fidelity** for analysis, but can share simple formats with other apps without losing the original detail.

📌 HI Media Storage Efficiency 
HI Media files store video, audio, depth/LiDAR, IMU sensors, and spatial channels in a single unified capture, without APIs or separated streams.
 Even with all modalities recorded together, the total storage impact remains extremely efficient:
File Size Multiplier
Audio: +0–5% (negligible)
IMU / Sensors: +1%
Spatial Audio: +5–12%
Depth / LiDAR: +15–45%
⭐ Final file size estimate:
1.25× – 1.50× the size of a normal video
— never 2×, never 3×, never anywhere near exponential.
This is possible because:
LiDAR frames pair directly with video frames (lightweight depth maps or point clouds)
Sensor streams are tiny numeric traces
Audio remains small relative to video
HI stores everything in a compact multimodal container rather than separate files
Impact
The file remains only slightly larger than normal video but infinitely more powerful
 (measurable frames, depth-aware editing, still extraction, stabilization, relighting, spatial navigation, etc.).
HI Media delivers a full 4D “scene capture” inside a file not much bigger than a standard MP4.

## 2. SYSTEM-7 — OTHER CHANNELS (BRIEF BUT COMPLETE)


Even though MEDIA is the most obvious, the **same pattern** applies to all 7 channels:


Each channel has:
- a “rich HI container” representation
- one or more “dumber exports” for other systems


### 2.1. CONTENT (Channel #2)


**What it is:**


- semantic meaning of what’s captured:
  - topics, themes, verses, concepts
  - tasks, decisions, goals
  - relationships between items (A depends on B, C blocks D)


**HI representation:**


- graph of concepts and relationships
- highlights and tags connected to specific media moments
- question/answer traces, reflections, journal entries


**Exports:**


- markdown docs
- outlines
- bullet lists
- CSV task lists


**Why revolutionary:**


- CONTENT is not “some notes over there” — it is **directly bound** to media, timeline, identity, and parameters.
- A verse, a decision, a regret, a win — all can be pinned to exact moments in media and time.


---


### 2.2. ENVIRONMENT (Channel #3)


**What it is:**


- physical and digital environment during capture:
  - location (coarse, safe; no creepy precision)
  - lighting, noise level, time of day
  - device context (phone, desktop, VR, etc.)
  - emotional context labels (if user opts in: “tired”, “hurried”)


**HI representation:**


- structured description of the “scene” around the action/capture.


**Exports:**


- plain metadata fields:
  - `timeOfDay`, `approxLocation`, `device`, `ambientLight`, etc.


**Why revolutionary:**


- Patterns like “every time you do this at 11:30pm you regret it” become visible without heavy tracking or creepy surveillance.
- Scheduling tools can make **human-sane suggestions**: “do this planning script in morning light, not at midnight.”


---


### 2.3. TIMELINE (Channel #4)


**What it is:**


- how things unfold over time:
  - sequences (steps)
  - phases
  - repetitions and loops
  - delay/gap patterns


**HI representation:**


- sequence of events, each bound to others:
  - journaling → planning → action → review → repentance → reset
  - trigger → drift → intervention → recovery


**Exports:**


- calendar events
- timelines
- Gantt-style phases
- serialized “script” for re-running sequences


**Why revolutionary:**


- Same “script” can be used:
  - for a video learning session,
  - a spiritual reset routine,
  - a build-a-shed project,
  - or a trading session —
  just with different media and content attached.


---


### 2.4. IDENTITY (Channel #5)


**What it is:**


- *who* is involved, in human-safe terms:
  - roles (self, spouse, children, manager, client)
  - preferences
  - maturity levels
  - trust levels


**HI representation:**


- role-based identity objects, not raw PII.


**Exports:**


- profiles, settings, “persona cards.”


**Why revolutionary:**


- The system can adapt tone, pace, and complexity **without** becoming creepy or predictive:
  - “This is your teen account, show simpler flows.”
  - “This is your contractor mode, show pricing and materials.”
  - “This is your prayer journal mode, show reflection prompts.”


---


### 2.5. PARAMETERS (Channel #6)


**What it is:**


- constraints, budgets, and knobs:
  - time limits
  - budget ranges
  - scope limits
  - risk tolerance
  - screen-time boundaries


**HI representation:**


- structured, user-owned “guardrails.”


**Exports:**


- simple numbers/labels used by:
  - planners
  - reminders
  - filters


**Why revolutionary:**


- Every “app” shares the same guardrails:
  - the journal doesn’t encourage 4-hour rabbit holes,
  - the project planner respects energy limits,
  - the drift scanner knows how much is too much for this person.


---


### 2.6. STYLE (Channel #7)


**What it is:**


- how things look, sound, and feel:
  - typography, colors, motion
  - density, spacing, contrast
  - cultural presets: Google-like, Business-like, Kids-like
  - spiritual tone for faith-branch vs neutral branch


**HI representation:**


- global 0-1 sliders and presets (later) that all atoms/molecules read from.


**Exports:**


- classic design tokens:
  - theme JSON
  - CSS variables
  - Tailwind-like tokens


**Why revolutionary:**


- One slider set can reshape:
  - journal
  - planner
  - drift scanner
  - learning sequences
  - contractor tools  
  without rewriting components — everything reads from the same style engine.

## 3. WHY SYSTEM-7 IS UNIQUE (ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY)


> System-7 is a **unified human model** where *every* app feature is just a different view on the same seven channels, instead of separate, incompatible tools — and HI MEDIA is the richest example of that pattern in action.
