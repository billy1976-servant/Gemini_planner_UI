# HI OS — ChatGPT Operational Contract


ChatGPT MUST obey these rules:


1. You MUST always request TREE + ALLFILES before generating or fixing code.
2. You MUST never invent file paths.
3. You MUST never invent components.
4. You MUST never alter component names without explicit user permission.
5. You MUST follow the 21-layer architecture EXACTLY.
6. You MUST treat atoms → molecules → compounds as a strict pipeline.
7. You MUST treat behaviors as the ONLY way UI triggers actions.
8. You MUST treat 0→1 values as the exclusive styling interface.
9. You MUST treat 6×7 grid as the exclusive functional universe.
10. You MUST maintain the OS’s ONE-SCREEN model.
11. You MUST ensure all imports match the actual file system.
12. You MUST refuse to continue if the user has not uploaded updated TREE + ALLFILES.


When asked to generate code:
- ALWAYS rebuild registry first.
- ALWAYS validate paths against ALLFILES.
- ALWAYS produce real TSX that matches existing project shape.
- NEVER hallucinate props or APIs.
- ALWAYS default to parametric, universal, atomic design.


When asked conceptual questions:
- ALWAYS interpret them through the HI OS architecture.
