# UX MEDIA PRIMITIVES — SURFACE / MEDIA / CONTENT (EXHAUSTIVE DEFINITION)


## 0. PURPOSE


The three UX primitives are the **bridge** between:


- the **abstract System-7 model** (MEDIA, CONTENT, ENVIRONMENT, etc.), and
- the **concrete atoms** (text, surface, media, field, trigger, etc.)


They are used by UI Compounds (Avatar, Card, Button, etc.) to build screens that:


- always render something meaningful,
- can “morph” with style or mode changes,
- can swap between apps (journal, planner, scanner) without rewriting everything.


The 3 primitives:


1. SurfacePrimitive
2. MediaPrimitive
3. ContentPrimitive


Each one wraps **multiple atoms** and knows *how to read* from the System-7 / HI configuration.

## 1. SURFACE PRIMITIVE


**Concept:**
> “SurfacePrimitive is the universal ‘card / panel / container’ for everything visual.”


### 1.1. What it wraps


Internally, SurfacePrimitive composes:


- `surface` atom (background, elevation, radius, border)
- `text` atom (titles, subtitles, labels)
- `shell` atom (padding and layout)
- optionally `collection` atom (for child stacks)


### 1.2. Inputs it reads


- from STYLE:
  - radius, shadow, border, density (0-1 later)
- from ENVIRONMENT:
  - preferred contrast (light/dark emphasis)
- from PARAMETERS:
  - what size/density is allowed, how “heavy” the surface can feel


### 1.3. Behavior hooks


SurfacePrimitive exposes simple props like:


- `onClick`
- `onHover`
- `selected`
- `variant` (“card”, “chip”, “banner”, etc.)


These map into the behavior engine via JSON:
- `onClick: { behavior: "sequence", params: {...} }`


**Why it matters:**


- Every compound that “looks like a card” doesn’t need its own full styling logic.
- Style changes (Google vs Kids vs Business) can flow through **one primitive** instead of 50 components.

## 2. MEDIA PRIMITIVE


**Concept:**
> “MediaPrimitive is the single place that knows how to display HI Media in any app.”


### 2.1. What it wraps


Internally, MediaPrimitive composes:


- `media` atom (img/video component)
- `surface` atom (background/border frame)
- `text` atom (caption, overlay labels)
- optionally measurement overlays (later) drawing on System-7 MEDIA:


It can render:


- static image thumbnails (from HI Media)
- playable video windows
- audio cards (with visual waveform)
- spatial previews (simple visual hints, 2D for now)
- annotation markers / tags


### 2.2. Inputs it reads


- from the HI Media container:
  - preview frame
  - duration
  - type (image, video, audio, mixed)
- from STYLE:
  - thumbnail shape (rounded vs square)
  - border and shadow
- from PARAMETERS:
  - size constraints, autoplay rules


### 2.3. Export / compatibility behavior


MediaPrimitive is the **single gateway** for:


- reading rich HI media,
- choosing a representation,
- and handing off “dumber exports” for other tools:
  - `onExport("mp4")`
  - `onExport("mp3")`
  - `onExport("jpg")`


In practice, the primitive just calls into a media helper or behavior:
- `runBehavior("media.export", { format: "mp4", mediaId })`


**Why it matters:**


- Any app you build (journal, drift scanner, stock visualizer, construction estimator) gets **the same media intelligence** for free.
- You never rebuild “video + audio + depth + annotations” logic inside each feature; it all goes through this primitive.

## 3. CONTENT PRIMITIVE


**Concept:**
> “ContentPrimitive is the universal text / description / explanation block that binds CONTENT to the screen.”


### 3.1. What it wraps


Internally, ContentPrimitive composes:


- `text` atom (headline, body, metadata)
- `collection` atom (stack of bullet points, questions, answers)
- `field` atom (optional inline input or reflection box)
- `sequence` atom (for ordered steps)


### 3.2. Inputs it reads


- from CONTENT (System-7):
  - main idea / title
  - key bullet points
  - associated verse or reference
  - reflection prompts
- from STYLE:
  - typography (weight, serifness, size — later via 0-1)
- from PARAMETERS:
  - max length
  - read vs write mode (is user editing?)


### 3.3. Behavior hooks


ContentPrimitive wires into behaviors for:


- “rephrase / simplify / expand” (HI-guided, deterministic)
- “save reflection”
- “link to next step” (e.g., planner, journal, tracker)
- “flag for review” (e.g., drift or conviction)


**Why it matters:**


- Every screen that shows “meaning” (not just raw media) can use the same structure.
- Your journal, drift scanner, and planner all show content in consistent, structured ways.

## 4. HOW THE THREE PRIMITIVES WORK TOGETHER


In a typical compound (e.g. Card, Stepper, Toast):


- `SurfacePrimitive` provides the **frame** and interaction area.
- `MediaPrimitive` shows the **what happened** (image, clip, waveform).
- `ContentPrimitive` shows the **what it means** and **what to do next**.


This same trio can power:


- a **HI video recorder** (media + surface overlays + content prompts),
- a **drift recovery card** (short clip + reflection text + button to respond),
- a **contractor estimate card** (site photo + measured dimensions + scope bullets),
- a **Scripture learning tile** (verse thumbnail art + verse text + prompt to recall).


The benefit:
- once these three are upgraded, **all 12 UI compounds** get smarter immediately.

## 5. WHY THIS IS REVOLUTIONARY (ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY)


> By centralizing all visual containers (Surface), all rich media (Media), and all semantic text/meaning (Content) into three primitives that sit above the atoms but below every app, HI OS can upgrade the entire system’s look, feel, function, and export power by touching just a few files instead of hundreds.



If you want, next step I can help you:
choose exact filenames and folders (e.g. src/definitions/system7-hi-media.def.txt, src/definitions/ux-primitives.def.txt), and
add a short “GPT starter” file that tells a new chat: “Read these definition files first, then ask me for project-tree.txt + project-allfiles.json.”
