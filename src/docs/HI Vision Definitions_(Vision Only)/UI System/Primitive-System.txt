# HI OS — Primitive System (Atoms, Molecules, Compounds)


## 1. ATOMS (9)
Atoms are the smallest irreducible building blocks of the OS. They do not know context.
They do not know screens. They only know how to express data and actions.


Atoms:
1. text
2. media
3. field
4. surface
5. shell
6. collection
7. condition
8. trigger
9. sequence


Each atom:
- Has a normalized signature.
- Accepts 0→1 scaled parameters.
- Exposes its behavior through the 6×7 function grid.
- Must render identically anywhere in the OS.


Atoms ARE the instruction set of the OS.


## 2. UX MOLECULES (3)
These wrap atoms into user-friendly interface units:
- MediaPrimitive
- SurfacePrimitive
- ContentPrimitive


They convert atomic outputs into coherent interface blocks.


## 3. UI COMPOUNDS (12)
These assemble molecules into real app behaviors (button, card, modal, toolbar, avatar, etc.).


A compound:
- Has no logic of its own.
- Delegates actions to Behavior Engine.
- Delegates rendering to molecules.
- Delegates meaning to JSON.


Compounds are the “interface layer” of the OS — but they remain parametric and universal.
