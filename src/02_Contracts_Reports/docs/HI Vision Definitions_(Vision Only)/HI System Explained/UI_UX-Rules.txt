# HI OS — UI/UX Rules: The One-Screen Interface Model


The OS never shows the user 200 options. It shows 3–6 OPTIONS that make sense RIGHT NOW.


Rules:
1. The screen adapts to the media type.
2. The screen adapts to the user mode (Kids, Developer, Minimalist).
3. The screen adapts to the sequence step.
4. The screen adapts to the user's skill.
5. The OS never exposes irrelevant tools.
6. Advanced features appear only when context requires them.
7. All UI uses compounds (12) + atoms/molecules.
8. Behavior Engine decides what to show next.
9. JSON determines the interface.


Photoshop Example:
- User loads a photo → OS exposes: "Enhance," "Cut Out," "Fix Color."
- User selects "Cut Out" → OS exposes: "Brush," "Auto," "Refine Edge."
- User selects "Auto" → OS exposes: "Preview," "Confirm," "Undo."
- User selects "Confirm" → OS exposes next relevant step.


This is NOT dumbing down tools.  
It is smart surfacing of tools.


Professionals gain speed.  
Beginners gain clarity.  
Both use the same OS without configuration.
