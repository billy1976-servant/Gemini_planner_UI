# HI OS — Photoshop Analogy (The One-Screen Paradigm)


Photoshop has 200 tools, dozens of panels, and deep UI complexity.


HI OS replaces all that with:
ONE screen
+ parametric sliders
+ context-aware actions (0–1 + 6×7)


User flow:
- user selects media (image/video/text)
- OS automatically offers top ~5 relevant actions
- complex features stay hidden unless needed


This allows:
- beginners to do professional
