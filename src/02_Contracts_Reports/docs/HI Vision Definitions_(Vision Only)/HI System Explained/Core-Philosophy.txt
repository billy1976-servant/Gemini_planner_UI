# HI OS — Core Philosophy & Universal Interface Model


HI OS is a parametric Human Operating System that unifies thousands of app-level
features into ONE SCREEN through universal primitives, universal functions,
universal sequences, and a universal 0→1 parameter engine.


This system replaces the “200 tools in 40 menus” model (Photoshop, Figma, Premiere)
with a new pattern:


    ONE screen → dynamically adapts itself → exposes only the 3–6 actions that make
    sense IN THIS CONTEXT, FOR THIS MEDIA, AT THIS STEP, FOR THIS USER.


The OS works because:
1. All UI is defined by JSON.
2. All functionality is driven by sequences.
3. All abilities come from 6×7 universal functions.
4. All styles come from 0→1 scaling.
5. All media types share the same verbs.
6. All atoms behave identically regardless of context.
7. All molecules translate UI into actions without the user needing to think.


HI OS is not an app.  
It is **1000 apps living inside one universal behavioral and interface engine**.


Any professional (designer, editor, coder) AND any beginner can use the same screen,
because the OS reveals only what is relevant, hiding the rest without removing power.


This document defines: why this works, how the OS thinks, and the purpose of the 21-layer architecture.
