(The universal 6 verbs × 7 media categories functional universe)
# HI OS — 6×7 Universal Function Grid


The OS has 6 universal verbs that apply to 7 universal media categories.


VERBS (6):
1. create
2. read
3. update
4. delete
5. transform
6. export


MEDIA TYPES (7):
1. text
2. image
3. audio
4. video
5. pdf/document
6. data/code
7. spatial (3D/LiDAR)


THE GRID:
Each media type automatically inherits all 6 universal verbs.


Example:
- text.transform = summarize | rewrite | translate | resize
- video.transform = cut | split | re-time | layer text | comp
- audio.transform = trim | normalize | remove noise | split
- 3D.transform = crop volume | rotate | scale | filter depth
- pdf.transform = extract text | compress | split pages


This grid reduces the functionality surface from thousands of special-case operations
to 42 universal functions that every atom understands.


This is one of the most revolutionary parts of the OS.
