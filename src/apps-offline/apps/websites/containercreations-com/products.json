Use a 2.5-inch carbide-tipped hole saw to drill a hole. Pop in the louver vents and press the tabs on the inside wall to keep it in place.\nThese vents can be installed a few inches above the floor evenly spaced on the sidewalls.\nThese vents use a .020-gauge aluminum for our round aluminum louvers, screens and plugs - most manufacturers use a thinner gauge, which leads to a weaker product. This thick, durable material maximizes lifespan and ensures proper ventilation needs."
