REFERENCE ONLY — NOT USED BY EXPORTER
======================================
Canonical modules live under src/01_App/apps-json/apps/ with blueprint.txt + content.txt. This folder is not read by compileApp().

TXT-ONLY BLUEPRINT CONTRACT
===========================

- blueprint.txt = exhaustive structure contract
- content.txt = activates structure by rawId
- compiler = blueprint + content → app.json
- new app = copy folder + edit content + compile
- NO engines generate structure
- NO TS trees define UI
- TXT ONLY system
