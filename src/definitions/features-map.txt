# HI CURV — FEATURES / APP MAP  (QuickBooks Analogy)


## 1. What is a “Feature” or “App”?


- A **Feature** (or app) is just a **named view** of the same underlying data.
- Examples: **Kanban**, **Calendar**, **Journal**, **Website Builder**, **Recovery Coach**, **Home Buying Helper**.
- Exactly like **QuickBooks reports** (P&L, Balance Sheet, Inventory):  
  same transactions, different **projection**.


A Feature **never owns the data**.  
It only decides **which data to show** and **which organs to use to show it.**


---


## 2. Layer Map (Feature → Organ → Molecule → Atom)


- **Feature** = “Which organs do we turn on, and how do we arrange them?”
- **Organ** = A reusable “UI organ” built from molecules  
  - Examples: `KanbanBoard`, `CalendarGrid`, `TaskList`, `NoteEditor`, `MediaStrip`
- **Molecules** = UI compounds (button, card, list row, field row, etc.)
- **Atoms** = 9 primitives (text, surface, media, field, trigger, condition, collection, sequence, shell)
- **Content + Behaviors** =  
  - Content = what fills atoms (text, images, tasks, scriptures, etc.)  
  - Behaviors = how they respond (click, navigate, save, toast, run sequence…)


So a Feature is literally:


> **Feature = [Organs] + [Layout rules] + [Data filters]**


---


## 3. Example Feature: KANBAN


**Name:** `Feature.Kanban`  
**Goal:** Show tasks grouped by status (To Do / Doing / Done) from the shared data engine.


- **Organs used**
  - `KanbanBoard` (columns + cards)
  - `TaskList` (for backlog or grouped lists)
  - `ContextPanel` (shows details when a card is selected)


- **Molecules used inside organs**
  - `Card` (task card)
  - `Button` (add, move, filter, view toggles)
  - `Chip / Tag` (labels, priorities)
  - `FieldRow` (quick inline edits)


- **Atoms used inside molecules**
  - `text` (title, description, labels)
  - `surface` (card background, columns, panels)
  - `media` (icons, avatars)
  - `field` (inputs)
  - `trigger` (buttons)
  - `collection` (lists of cards)
  - `sequence` (animations / transitions if needed)
  - `shell` (overall layout)


- **Content**
  - Comes **from the shared data engine** (tasks, projects, tags, dates).
  - Kanban **only filters & groups**: e.g., `status IN [Todo, Doing, Done]`.


- **QuickBooks analogy**
  - Like “P&L by Class”: same transactions, grouped differently.
  - Changing status of a card is like changing a transaction’s account/class.

## 4. Example Feature: CALENDAR


**Name:** `Feature.Calendar`  
**Goal:** Show time-based items (tasks, events, reminders) on a timeline grid.


- **Organs used**
  - `CalendarGrid` (month/week/day layout)
  - `TaskList` or `EventList` (compact list for navigation)
  - `ContextPanel` (details or quick-edit)


- **Projection only**
  - Uses the **same task/event data** as Kanban.
  - Only changes:
    - **Grouping:** by date/time instead of status
    - **Organs:** grid instead of columns
    - **Molecules:** time slots instead of Kanban cards


---


## 5. Example Feature: WEBSITE BUILDER (Dumb / MVP)


**Name:** `Feature.WebsiteBuilder`  
**Goal:** Take content (e.g. from a church site), store it, and project it as a new site layout.


- **Organs used**
  - `SectionList` (hero, about, sermons, contact, etc.)
  - `BlockEditor` (per-section editing)
  - `PreviewPane` (live preview)


- **Data flow**
  - Content ingested → stored in the same **content engine** (texts, media, routes).
  - Website Builder is just another **view + editor** on that content.
  - Later, the same content can appear in:
    - a Kanban (website tasks),
    - Calendar (content schedule),
    - Journal (planning notes).


---


## 6. The “Brain” / Data Engine (QuickBooks Core)


- Think of the **Brain** as the “QuickBooks database”:
  - It holds **all atomic facts**: tasks, notes, tags, people, events, web blocks, etc.
  - It knows **relationships**: “this task belongs to this project”, “this project belongs to this life-area”.
- Features **never store their own data**.  
  They:
  1. Ask the Brain: “give me all items of type X that match filters Y”
  2. Hand that list down to Organs → Molecules → Atoms to render.


So:


> **Brain = shared content + relations**  
> **Organs = reusable UI structures over that content**  
> **Features = named presets of organs + filters (reports)**


---


## 7. Why this matters for HI CURV


- You can build **many features** (Kanban, Calendar, Website Builder, Recovery Coach, etc.)
  **without duplicating data or UI code**.
- A new Feature is “just”:
  - A **definition file** saying:
    - which organs to mount
    - which filters to apply
    - which variants/themes to use
  - A small JSON/TSX glue layer to hook it into the main screen.


This file is the **map** that explains to any new dev/chat:


> “We are NOT building 20 separate apps.  
> We are building ONE shared brain with many report-style views.”
