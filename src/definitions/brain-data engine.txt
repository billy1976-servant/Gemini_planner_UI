========================================
 HI CURV — BRAIN / CONTENT ENGINE
 (QuickBooks-style content organizer)
========================================


1. PURPOSE


The Brain is the **central content engine** of HI CURV.


It does NOT render UI.
It does NOT decide visual layout.
It does NOT care if content is shown as Kanban, Calendar, Journal, or Website.


Its only job is to:
- Collect content and events from everywhere in the system
- Normalize it into a small set of core entities
- Track relationships between those entities
- Answer questions like “What should this view show right now?”


Think of it exactly like QuickBooks:
- Every click a user makes is like a “transaction”
- Every task, note, event, or file is an “item” or “record”
- Kanban / Calendar / Reports are just **different reports** of the SAME data




2. CORE ENTITIES


The Brain stores everything as a small set of canonical entities
(even if they come from different apps/organs):


- PERSON: contacts, family, friends, clients, mentors
- PROJECT: any goal or initiative (build chicken coop, buy a house, launch app)
- TASK: actionable items (call roofer, buy lumber, email pastor)
- EVENT: time-bound entries (meeting, due date, appointment)
- RESOURCE: content or media (docs, links, videos, PDFs, verses, website chunks)
- TAG / CONTEXT: labels and locations (home, church, business, finance, drift type)
- STATE SNAPSHOT: emotional, spiritual, or focus “state” at a certain time


The Brain always cares about:
  - WHAT is this? (entity type)
  - WHO is it related to?
  - WHICH project does it touch?
  - WHEN does it matter?
  - WHERE should it show up? (Kanban, Calendar, Journal, etc.)
  - WHY is it important? (priority, drift, goals, calling)




3. INPUTS — WHERE DATA COMES FROM


The Brain receives inputs from:


- ATOMS: text typed, media added, checkboxes toggled, selections made
- MOLECULES: button clicks, form submits, list interactions, card moves
- ORGANS: Kanban moves, Calendar edits, Journal entries, Website builder steps
- IMPORTERS: scraped church site, copied landing page, uploaded docs
- BEHAVIOR ENGINE: “save”, “complete”, “archive”, “drift detected”, etc.


Every interaction is turned into a **Brain event**, for example:
- `task.created`
- `task.completed`
- `task.moved.stage`
- `project.created`
- `resource.imported`
- `state.driftDetected`
… and those events update the canonical entities.




4. OUTPUTS — WHAT THE BRAIN PROVIDES


The Brain does NOT format UI.
Instead, it answers **queries** from organs/views, like:


- “Give me all TASKS for project = ‘Chicken Coop’ grouped by stage”
- “Give me all EVENTS for this week for this user”
- “Give me all TASKS and EVENTS related to ‘Church Website’”
- “Give me all RESOURCES related to ‘Buying a House’ tagged ‘finance’”
- “What are the top 5 drifts for this person this month?”


Organs use those answers to render their version:
- Kanban organ draws columns and cards from TASKS
- Calendar organ draws blocks from EVENTS
- Journal organ draws ordered entries from TASKS + NOTES + STATE
- Website builder organ draws SECTIONS from RESOURCES + TASKS




5. VIEW vs DATA — QUICKBOOKS ANALOGY


QUICKBOOKS:
- Transactions = raw content
- Chart of Accounts = structure
- Reports = different lenses (P&L, Balance Sheet, Inventory)


HI CURV:
- Brain entities = raw content
- Relationships = structure (person–project–task–event–resource)
- Organs (Kanban, Calendar, Journal, Website) = different lenses / reports


So:
- Changing the view NEVER changes the canonical data model
- One project can appear as Kanban + Calendar + Journal + Drift map simultaneously
- Morphing between views is just: “ask the Brain a different question, draw it differently”




6. ROLE IN THE ORGANISM


If:
- ATOMS are physics,
- MOLECULES are components,
- ORGANS are functional systems (Kanban, Calendar, Journal),


…then the BRAIN is the **nervous system + memory** that keeps them all in sync.


Every organ:
- Subscribes to the Brain
- Asks for its slice of the world
- Renders that slice with atoms and molecules, nothing else


The Brain is the **one and only source of truth** for content.
