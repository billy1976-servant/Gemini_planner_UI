CONTENT VIEWS (Kanban / Calendar / Journal as Pure Projections)
Core idea
Content is stored once, in normalized form, in the Brain’s ledger.
Kanban, Calendar, Journal, Website, Drift maps, etc. are pure views:
Kanban = grouped by status / lane
Calendar = grouped by time
Journal = grouped by sequence / narrative
Website = grouped by audience / structure
Why morphology is possible
Because all views:
pull from the same underlying objects (tasks, notes, media),
simply ask for different slices and groupings.
Morphing from “calendar” to “Kanban” is just:
telling the Brain: “same objects, different projection,”
swapping which organ is active on screen.
