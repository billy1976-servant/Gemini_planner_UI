2️⃣ MOLECULES — COMPOUNDS + QUICKBOOKS/REPORT ANALOGY
File suggestion: src/system/definitions/molecules-and-organs.md
 (You can rename later, but I’m including QuickBooks / report analogy in the title section as you asked.)
Molecules = Compounds that arrange atoms
A molecule (compound) is:
“A reusable pattern that chooses and arranges atoms into a meaningful UI object.”
Examples:
ButtonCompound – uses:
surface (button body)
text (label)
media (optional icon)
trigger (click action)
CardCompound – uses:
surface (card body)
media (image/icon)
text (title/subtitle/body)
collection (list of items inside the card)
The molecule itself is still simple TSX:
It doesn’t know about Kanban, calendar, “website builder”, etc.
It just says: “For this pattern, I want 1 surface + 1 text + 1 media + 1 trigger, wired like this.”

Where variants live (and why molecules stay tiny)
Molecules do not contain variants like “primary button”, “secondary button”, “ghost button”.
Instead:
The molecule just defines slots (label text, icon, layout, density, emphasis).
A molecule JSON definition (e.g. button.compound.json) specifies:
Families/variants: ["primary", "ghost", "danger", "icon-only", ...]
For each variant, which atom sliders to use:
Text size / weight
Surface elevation / radius
Media icon style
Spacing and padding
The screen JSON or organ JSON picks “which variant” to use in context.
So:
Molecule TSX = fixed wiring of atoms
Molecule JSON = variant recipes
Screen JSON = which recipe is active right now

Organs & QuickBooks analogy (where this is heading)
You introduced:
Organs – like Kanban, Calendar, Journal, Website Builder, etc.
Brain / Content Engine – the “QuickBooks” part that owns the data
QuickBooks Analogy:
The data engine = chart of accounts + transactions (your unified content/tasks/life data)
The views/reports = calendar view, Kanban view, list view, journal view, etc.
In that analogy:
Atoms = the raw UI primitives (text cells, lines, boxes, icons)
Molecules = reusable UI widgets (button, card, list, input row)
Organs = the screens/widgets that feel like “apps” (Kanban, Calendar, Journal)
Brain / QuickBooks-style Engine = the part that decides which data feeds each organ and how it’s grouped/filtered.
This file (molecules/compounds definition) should:
Stay focused on how molecules wire atoms
Explicitly reference that organs will combine multiple molecules
Explicitly reference that QuickBooks/report-style views are just different organs showing the same underlying data in different ways.

Summary contracts for molecules
Molecules never define global style → they reuse atom + UI tokens.
Variants are chosen by JSON, not baked into TSX.
Any organ/screen (Kanban, Calendar, etc.) is just a JSON tree that:
Picks which molecules to use
Picks which variants/families for those molecules
Lets the global “brain” decide what data flows into them.
