# HI OS — Behavior Engine, Verbs, Triggers, Sequences


The Behavior Engine is the universal translator between UI and action.


Every action in the OS uses the SAME shape:


    { behavior: "verb.name", params: {...} }


## 1. VERBS
Universal verbs include:
- state.set
- ui.toast
- ui.navigate
- ui.highlight
- sequence.start
- sequence.next
- media.process
- content.generate
- content.transform


Verbs are global. They apply to ANY media type.


## 2. TRIGGERS
Triggers include:
- onPress
- onChange
- onLoad
- onStepDone
- onSequenceEnd


Triggers connect compounds → behaviors → engine.


## 3. SEQUENCES
A sequence is a list of universal steps, e.g.:


    edit-video:
      - media.cut
      - media.split
      - sequence.branch(select-clips)
      - media.comp(audio,text)
      - media.render
      - upload.youtube
      - stamp.hi-authenticity


Sequences unify ALL tools across:
- images
- audio
- video
- PDF
- code
- text
- 3D / LiDAR


The OS reduces the entire functionality universe to a few universal verbs.
