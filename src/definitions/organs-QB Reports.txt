========================================
 HI CURV — ORGANS / VIEW ENGINES
 (Kanban, Calendar, Journal, Website, etc.)
========================================


1. PURPOSE


ORGANS are higher-level “view engines” built from MOLECULES.


- An organ is NOT a whole app.
- It is a **reusable functional chunk** (like “Kanban Board” or “Calendar Grid”)
- The same organ can appear in many screens and many apps.


Each organ:
- Chooses WHICH MOLECULES to use (buttons, lists, cards, surfaces)
- Decides HOW they are arranged
- Asks the BRAIN WHAT data to show
- Knows HOW to translate Brain data into visible UI atoms


Example organs:
- Kanban Organ
- Calendar Organ
- Journal Organ
- Drift Scanner Organ
- Website Builder Organ
- Scripture Memory Organ
- Video Editor Organ (cut/split/stamp engine surface)




2. ORGANS vs MOLECULES vs ATOMS


- ATOMS = universal physics (text, surface, media, field, trigger, etc.)
- MOLECULES = reusable component recipes (button, card, list, navbar, chip, modal)
- ORGANS = functional systems composed of many molecules


For example, a KANBAN ORGAN might use:
- Surface molecules for columns
- Card molecules for tasks
- Button molecules for actions
- List molecules for backlogs
- Trigger molecules for moves and filters


None of the organ files reinvent physics.
They just orchestrate molecules and ask the Brain for the right data.




3. HOW ORGANS GET DATA (BRAIN QUERIES)


Each organ defines its “questions” to the Brain.


Kanban Organ example:
- Query: “all tasks where project = X, grouped by stage”
- Renders: one column per stage, one card per task


Calendar Organ:
- Query: “all events for date range [start, end] and user = X”
- Renders: grid of days, events snapped to dates


Website Builder Organ:
- Query: “all sections belonging to site = X ordered by position”
- Renders: stacked surface + media + text molecules per section


Journal Organ:
- Query: “all entries, tasks, and events for day = X, grouped by context”
- Renders: timeline of text + events + drifts




4. HOW ORGANS LIVE IN SCREENS (MORPHING)


Screens are **just JSON** that place organs on a layout surface.


One screen can:
- Place multiple organs at once (Kanban + Calendar + Journal)
- Show shared content from the Brain in different ways
- Swap one organ configuration for another (“Kanban view” → “Calendar view”)


Morphing is simply:
- The screen JSON changing which organ is active / visible
- Or the organ changing its “mode” (e.g., Kanban organ toggles “group by project” vs “group by stage”)


The user experiences everything as if it’s ONE app, because:
- The same Brain data underlies all organs
- The same atoms/molecules render everything
- The same screen can host multiple organ modes




5. ORGANS AND SEQUENCES (OPERATIONS)


Some organs represent not just views, but **operations**.


Example: Video Editor Organ (cut / split / stamp / overlay / export)
- Reuses the same atoms (media, surface, trigger, sequence)
- Uses sequences to call behaviors: cut video, extract audio, apply 6×7 pipeline, etc.
- Still gets inputs/outputs from the Brain (resources & tasks)


Similarly, Website Builder Organ:
- Uses sequences to scaffold a page from imported content
- Links tasks, resources, and events into a build plan




6. ORGAN LAYER SUMMARY


Organs are:
- NOT full apps
- NOT atoms or molecules
- The “organs” of the organism — each with a clear role (motion, memory, time, structure)


They:
- Consume Brain data
- Arrange molecules
- Render atoms
- Can be turned ON/OFF or swapped per screen without breaking the system
