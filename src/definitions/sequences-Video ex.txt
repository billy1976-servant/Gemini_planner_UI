SEQUENCES (Media-Agnostic “Cut / Stamp / Move” Engine)
What sequences are
A Sequence is a reusable operation recipe that can run over any media type:
video, audio, text, images, PDFs, tasks, Kanban cards, etc.
Example: your 6×7 engine:
operations like cut, copy, split, stamp, merge, overlay, export
applied across different content types.
Where sequences live
Implementation-wise:
Lives in a behavior + sequence engine (under behavior/).
Receives instructions from JSON (“run cut→split→stamp over this set of items”).
Organs (like video editor, Kanban, website builder) call sequences, they don’t re-implement them.
QuickBooks analogy
Sequences are like saved procedures or automations:
“Every month, close books.”
“Every week, generate invoice batch.”
In HI-CURV:
“Every time I capture a clip, cut to 15s, add intro, queue for export.”
“Every time I start a project, create Kanban lanes, calendar milestones, and journal prompts.”
