========================================
 HI CURV — ASSISTANT / INVOLUNTARY LOGIC
 (Voluntary vs involuntary actions, UX brain)
========================================


1. PURPOSE


The Assistant layer is the **guidance brain** of HI CURV.


It is NOT the Brain (content engine).
It is NOT the Organs (views).
It is the part that behaves like a **coach + reflex system**:


- Voluntary: user clicks, drags, types, requests help
- Involuntary: system nudges, warns, suggests, auto-chains sequences


Analogy:
- Heartbeat is involuntary.
- Hand movements are voluntary.
- Reflexes (pull hand from fire) are a mix of both.


The Assistant layer is where those “reflexes” and “coaching moments” live.




2. INPUTS — WHAT THE ASSISTANT WATCHES


The Assistant listens to:


- Brain events:
  - tasks created/completed
  - drifts detected
  - overdue items
  - cluster of related tasks
- Organ activity:
  - Kanban stuck columns
  - Calendar overload
  - Journal patterns (many sad entries, many angry entries)
- Time patterns:
  - midnight habits
  - weekend behaviors
  - long gaps with no progress


It DOES NOT own the data.
It only **observes** what the Brain and Organs are already doing.




3. OUTPUTS — WHAT THE ASSISTANT DOES


The Assistant responds with:


- Nudges:
  - “Do you want to turn this pattern into a Project?”
  - “This task has been delayed 3 times; move it to a smaller chunk?”
  - “You seem overwhelmed; want to see a simpler Kanban?”


- Auto-sequences:
  - Trigger a short HI FIREWALL scan when drift spikes
  - Trigger a micro-planning sequence for a big task
  - Suggest website-build steps after content import


- Smart defaults:
  - When user adds “Build chicken coop,” offer a scaffold:
    - Organs: Kanban + Calendar
    - Tasks: pre-filled template
    - Views: initial Kanban board + timeline




4. VOLUNTARY vs INVOLUNTARY


Voluntary:
- User clicks a button: “Add Project,” “Open Kanban,” “Import Website”
- User chooses a slider: small / medium / large, view modes, filters


Involuntary:
- System quietly flags risky patterns and offers help
- “You’ve moved this task 4 times; want to break it down?”
- “You just captured 5 links about home buying; start a Home Buying Project?”


Both use the same building blocks:
- Behaviors
- Sequences
- Organs
- Brain events


The Assistant layer simply decides **when to call them without being asked.**




5. QUICKBOOKS ANALOGY (ASSISTANT LAYER)


In QuickBooks:
- User voluntarily enters transactions
- System involuntarily:
  - warns about duplicates
  - suggests categories
  - gives alerts for taxes, payroll, overdue invoices


In HI CURV:
- User voluntarily creates tasks, projects, journal entries, imports content
- Assistant involuntarily:
  - suggests grouping items into projects/organs
  - nudges to run HI FIREWALL when patterns look dangerous
  - offers different views (Kanban vs Calendar) when complexity increases




6. UX ROLE IN THE ORGANISM


If:
- Brain = memory + nervous system
- Organs = functional systems (motion, planning, time, reflection)
- Atoms/Molecules = cells and tissues


Then:
- The Assistant = **the part of the brain that watches everything and helps you adapt.**


It:
- Never owns the content
- Never owns the view
- Only orchestrates behaviors to keep the user safe, focused, and encouraged


This is the layer that will eventually make HI CURV feel like:
- “It understands what I’m trying to do”
- “It warns me before I crash”
- “It gently steers me toward simplicity and faithfulness”
