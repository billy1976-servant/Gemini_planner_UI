# Master images

Place representative images here so generated apps can copy them. Suggested assets:

- **hero** — Hero section image (office, team, or professional)
- **practice area icons** — Optional icons for practice areas
- **about** — Firm or attorney photo
- **background** — Section background (optional)

Use the same filenames or paths that your compiler expects (e.g. relative paths or CDN URLs in content.txt).
