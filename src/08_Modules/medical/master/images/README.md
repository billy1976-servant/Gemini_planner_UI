# Master images

Place representative images here so generated apps can copy them. Suggested assets:

- **hero** — Hero section image (clinic, team, or care-focused)
- **service icons** — Optional icons for services
- **about** — Practice or provider photo
- **testimonial** — Optional placeholder faces (with permission)

Use the same filenames or paths that your compiler expects (e.g. relative paths or CDN URLs in content.txt).
