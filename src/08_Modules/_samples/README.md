# Sample and template reference

This folder holds **reference copies** of sample/template content so that 08_Modules is the single source of truth for template-style content.

- **doctor** — Copy of the doctor template (hero, services grid, about, testimonials, FAQ, contact). Use as reference for richer content structures; vertical masters use the RootSection blueprint.
- Add other demo/sample content here when moving assets from elsewhere in the repo.

Template apps under `01_App/apps-json/apps/templates/` (e.g. doctor, test-module) remain for the app dropdown and compile flow; canonical sample content for Modules lives here.
