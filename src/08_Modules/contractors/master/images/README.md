# Master images

Place representative images here so generated apps can copy them. Suggested assets:

- **hero** — Hero section background or lead image
- **service icons** — Optional icons for services list
- **about** — Team or workspace photo
- **background** — Section background or texture (optional)

Use the same filenames or paths that your compiler expects (e.g. relative paths or CDN URLs in content.txt).
