# Auto Refactor Task

This file is a **template** for refactor tasks generated by the **System Control Center** (`?screen=tsx:system/SystemControlCenter`).

## How to use

1. Open the app and go to **System Control Center** (e.g. `?screen=tsx:system/SystemControlCenter`).
2. Run a scan, then click **CREATE NEW CURSOR TASK FILE**.
3. Copy the generated content or download as `AUTO_REFACTOR_TASK.md` and replace this file (or paste into Cursor chat).

## Template structure (populated by Control Center)

- **Selected problem areas** — Scan options that were enabled (engines, runtime, registries, etc.).
- **Step-by-step fix order** — Recommended sequence: registries → paths → engines → blocks → runtime.
- **Counts** — From last scan: warnings, duplicates, legacy paths, engines, registries.
- **Safety** — Read-only; no automatic file moves or import rewrites.

## Safety rules

- Do **not** move files, rename folders, or rewrite imports unless explicitly requested.
- Scan + report only; execute refactors only after user approval.
