# ROUND 2 — Execution Plan (superseded)

**Superseded by:** [MASTER_ROUND2_PLAN.md](MASTER_ROUND2_PLAN.md).

The authoritative Round 2 execution plan is **MASTER_ROUND2_PLAN.md** (Structural Unification). It contains the file reduction model, top 20 high-impact merges, engine structure check, JSON consolidation map, and recommended execution order.

Phase-level docs in `execution_plans/` remain for granular tasks; they should be read in conjunction with MASTER_ROUND2_PLAN.md.
