# ROUND 2 — Phase 10: Integrity Pass

**Goal:** Full test run; sign-off; no regressions.

---

## Objectives

1. Run full test suite (or agreed subset: runtime-pipeline-contract, critical-path, calculator/organ tests if touched).
2. Confirm no boundary violations: layout does not write state; behavior does not resolve layout; single content entrypoint; Registry single component map.
3. Document ROUND 2 completion: list phases done, files changed, any deferred items.

---

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] All tests in scope pass.
- [ ] Boundary checklist signed off for ROUND 2.
- [ ] refactor_ROUND 2/ROUND2_FINAL_REPORT.md (or equivalent) created at execution time: phases 1–10 status, files changed, risks deferred.

---

## Files to touch (planning)

- (At execution) refactor_ROUND 2/ROUND2_FINAL_REPORT.md
- No code changes in this phase; verification only.

---

*Planning only; execution later.*
