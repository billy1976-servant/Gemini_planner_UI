    "price": "49.99",
    "description": "These intake vents fit on the vertical ribs of your shipping container walls to provide airflow for your AdaptAIR™ roof ventilation. We recommend installing at least ten of these 2.5-inch louver vents for each AdaptAIR vent on your container. Very simple to install. Use a 2.5-inch carbide-tipped hole saw to drill a hole. Pop in the louver vents and press the tabs on the inside wall to keep it in place. These vents can be installed a few inches above the floor evenly spaced on the sidewalls. These vents use a .020-gauge aluminum for our round aluminum louvers, screens and plugs - most manufacturers use a thinner gauge, which leads to a weaker product. This thick, durable material maximizes lifespan and ensures proper ventilation needs.",

    "price": "49.99",
    "description": "These intake vents fit on the vertical ribs of your shipping container walls to provide airflow for your AdaptAIR™ roof ventilation. We recommend installing at least ten of these 2.5-inch louver vents for each AdaptAIR vent on your container. Very simple to install. Use a 2.5-inch carbide-tipped hole saw to drill a hole. Pop in the louver vents and press the tabs on the inside wall to keep it in place. These vents can be installed a few inches above the floor evenly spaced on the sidewalls. These vents use a .020-gauge aluminum for our round aluminum louvers, screens and plugs - most manufacturers use a thinner gauge, which leads to a weaker product. This thick, durable material maximizes lifespan and ensures proper ventilation needs.",
