# 08 — Diagnostics

**Source:** Compiled from `src/docs/ARCHITECTURE_AUTOGEN/SYSTEM_DIAGNOSTICS.generated.md`, `PIPELINE_DIAGNOSTIC_TRACE_REPORT.md`, `src/system-reports/summaries/`, `src/docs/RUNTIME/CURSOR_SYSTEM_FILES_UPDATE_PROTOCOL.md`.

---

## System diagnostics report (screens / scans)

- **Screens found (example):** apps, dashboard.json, diagnostics, websites.
- **Planned extensions:** Registry, behavior, layout, state scans (TODO in generator output).
- **Source:** system-diagnostics.generator.ts output → SYSTEM_DIAGNOSTICS.generated.md. This pack reads that output; does not regenerate it.

---

## Pipeline debug flow

- **Pipeline stages:** action (event received) → behavior (verb matched) → state (dispatchState) → layout (override applied) → render (pass).
- **Pipeline debug store:** src/devtools/pipeline-debug-store.ts; pipelineStageTrace (src/engine/debug/pipelineStageTrace.ts) records stages.
- **InteractionTracerPanel:** Document-level handler for click/change/input; setLastEvent; reads getLastPipelineTrace(). **Known issue:** Clearing trace in document handler before action event dispatches can show action FAIL / empty trace; fix: clear trace at start of behavior-listener "action" callback, not in document handler.
- **Active node / section row:** Active node id from DOM (e.g. section-layout-preset-${sectionKey}). Section rows keyed by section id (e.g. features_section). Normalize: if activeId is section-layout-preset-<sectionKey>, use sectionKey for row lookup (same for card-layout-preset-, organ-internal-layout-).

---

## Pipeline diagnostic trace (layout dropdown example)

- **Observed:** Section layout dropdown (e.g. features_section → "content-narrow"); state shows update; section table showed different layout (e.g. features-grid-3).
- **Causes traced:** (1) Active node id = section-layout-preset-features_section vs section rows keyed by features_section — normalize control ids to section keys. (2) Trace cleared on document click/change before action handler runs — move resetPipelineTrace to start of action handler in behavior-listener. (3) behavior FAIL "No behavior matched" for state:update is expected — state mutation is via dispatchState in action listener, not contract verb. (4) Section table layout vs state: ensure section table reads resolved layout from same source as renderer (override → node.layout → template default).
- **Files:** InteractionTracerPanel.tsx (normalize activeId; do not reset trace in document handler); behavior-listener.ts (resetPipelineTrace at start of action handler).

## Failure tracking logic

- **Behavior listener:** Warns on "[action] Missing action name", "[navigate] Missing destination", "[behavior-runner] failed", "[action] Unhandled action". No silent swallows on primary path; throw, warn, or documented return.
- **State/store:** Errors surface via return/log; screen-loader and API return 404 or throw as appropriate.
- **Dev-only:** evaluateCompatibility console.debug; behavior-listener console.log/groupCollapsed; runtime-decision-trace; diagnostics panels — gated by dev/build flags; do not change production paths.

---

## System reports and summaries

- **Snapshots:** src/system-reports/snapshots/<timestamp>/SYSTEM_SUMMARY.md — file count, runtime vs generated ratio, top central files, suspected duplication zones, trunk candidates, risk areas (large files).
- **Summaries:** src/system-reports/summaries/AI_SNAPSHOT_PACK.md, AI_SNAPSHOT_PACK.json, LATEST_CHANGE_SUMMARY.md — spine, contracts, critical integration map, debug recipe.
- **Usage:** Read these for diagnostics and pipeline proof; do not delete or replace. Generators (generate-reachability-report.ts, system-diagnostics.generator.ts) remain the source of truth; this pack compiles from their outputs.

---

## Update protocol (docs only — no rescan here)

- **CURSOR_SYSTEM_FILES_UPDATE_PROTOCOL.md:** When autogenerated docs feel out of date: (1) Scan repo structure (entry points, pipeline stages, layout flow, behavior/state wiring, registry, data flow). (2) Re-derive contracts in memory only; do not regenerate docs yet. (3) Compare against existing ARCHITECTURE_AUTOGEN, SYSTEM_MAP_AUTOGEN, SYSTEM_INTELLIGENCE_AUTOGEN; identify meaningful architectural differences. (4) Update only changed sections; diff-first, not full regeneration.
- **This consolidation pack:** Does not run scans or generators. It only reads existing docs and system-reports and compiles into the master files in system-architecture/.
