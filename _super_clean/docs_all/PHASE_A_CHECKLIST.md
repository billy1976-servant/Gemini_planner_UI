# Phase A — Wrapper H-Padding Neutralization: Manual Check List

After each step, run the app and verify at least one screen renders.

- [ ] **App experience:** Content should be less indented left/right (no wrapper horizontal padding).
- [ ] **Learning experience:** Content should be less indented left/right.
- [ ] **Website experience:** Should be unchanged (no H padding there before).

Steps: A1 (ExperienceRenderer) → A2 (LearningShell) → A3 (AppShell) → A4 (page.tsx comment only).
