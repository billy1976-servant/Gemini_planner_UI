# Workflow Rules (MANDATORY)

1. Never start coding without reading all docs in this folder.
2. Never create new systems that duplicate existing ones.
3. Always update PLAN_ACTIVE.md before starting a new implementation phase.
4. After completing work, append a summary to CHANGELOG.md.
5. All major structural changes must be reflected in MAP.md.
6. If unsure, stop and ask for clarification before proceeding.
7. The goal is step-by-step planned progress — not spontaneous edits.
