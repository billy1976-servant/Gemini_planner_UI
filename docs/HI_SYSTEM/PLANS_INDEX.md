# Plans index

**Classification:** REFERENCE — Index of core docs and active plans; primary architecture reference: docs/SYSTEM_MASTER/

Current active plans and links to plan docs.

## Core docs (this folder)

- **[START_HERE.md](START_HERE.md)** — If you're new, read this first.
- **[MAP.md](MAP.md)** — System map (screens, renderer, layout, shells, skin, engine, compilers, wired / not wired / missing).
- **[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)** — Current phase (A–D); single place for "what phase we are in."
- **[PLAN_ACTIVE.md](PLAN_ACTIVE.md)** — Single current plan we edit going forward (Phases A–D).
- **[WORKFLOW_RULES.md](WORKFLOW_RULES.md)** — Mandatory workflow: read docs before coding, update PLAN_ACTIVE/CHANGELOG/MAP as required.
